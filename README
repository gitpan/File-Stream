File::Stream version 2.10
=========================

Perl filehandles are streams, but sometimes they just aren't powerful enough.
This module offers to have streams from filehandles searched with regexes
and allows the global input record separator variable to contain regexes.

Thus, readline() and the <> operator can now return records delimited
by regular expression matches.

Please see the POD documentation in the module file for important CAVEATS.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   ./Build install

On platforms that don't support the "./" notation, that would be:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

If you wish, you may use the old MakeMaker style instead:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Carp
  Test::More
  YAPE::Regex

CONTRIBUTIONS

Many thanks go to Simon Cozens for the original idea and much valuable
input. It was great fun talking about some of the weirder features of Perl.
Equally many thanks to Autrijus Tang for much help with the fiendish regexes
I couldn't handle and Ben Tilly for suggesting the use of the ${} regex
construct.

Also, I owe thanks to Jeff 'japhy' Pinyan for writing the YAPE::Regex
module which made my life much easier.
