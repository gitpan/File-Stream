File::Stream version 1.10
=========================

Perl filehandles are streams, but sometimes they just aren't powerful enough.
This module offers to have streams from filehandles searched with regexes
and allows the global input record separator variable to contain regexes.

Thus, readline() and the <> operator can now return records delimited
by regular expression matches.

Please see the POD documentation in the module file for important CAVEATS.

CONTRIBUTIONS

Many thanks go to Simon Cozens for the original idea and much valuable
input. It was great fun talking about some of the weirder features of Perl.
Equally many thanks to Autrijus Tang for much help with the fiendish regexes
I couldn't handle and Ben Tilly for suggesting the use of the ${} regex
construct.
